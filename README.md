Homework 3
Re implemented Login functionality, on succefull login: session is stored.
While logged in, log out option appears at index page.
If you try to sign up or log in again while already logged in, session clears before attempt.
Stories href can be found on Index.
On stories page, users can see all posts by all users.
If user is logged in: Post Box appears where user can upload his story.
Post is then stored in the database with story author taken from the session.
So only authenticated users can post stories but all users can see stories.
